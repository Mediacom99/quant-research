1. Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)

    Objective: Minimize portfolio variance for a given level of expected return, or maximize expected return for a given level of risk.
    Objective Function:
    Minimize12wTΣw−λwTμ
    Minimize21​wTΣw−λwTμ
    where ww is the vector of portfolio weights, ΣΣ is the covariance matrix of returns, λλ is a risk aversion coefficient, and μμ is the vector of expected returns.

2. Minimum Variance Portfolio

    Objective: Minimize the total variance of the portfolio.
    Objective Function:
    MinimizewTΣw
    MinimizewTΣw
    subject to wT1=1wT1=1, where 11 is a vector of ones.

3. Maximum Sharpe Ratio (Tangency Portfolio)

    Objective: Maximize the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, which is the ratio of excess return to standard deviation.
    Objective Function:
    MaximizewTμ−rfwTΣw
    MaximizewTΣw

    ​wTμ−rf​​
    where rfrf​ is the risk-free rate.

4. Risk Parity

    Objective: Allocate portfolio weights so that each asset contributes equally to the overall portfolio risk.
    Objective Function:
    Minimize∑i=1N(wiσi−σpN)2
    Minimizei=1∑N​(wi​σi​−Nσp​​)2
    where σiσi​ is the volatility of asset ii, σpσp​ is the portfolio volatility, and NN is the number of assets.

5. Equal-Weighted Portfolio

    Objective: Assign equal weights to all assets in the portfolio.
    Objective Function:
    No optimization needed, as weights are simply:
    wi=1N
    wi​=N1​
    for all ii.

6. Maximum Diversification

    Objective: Maximize the diversification ratio, which is the ratio of the weighted average volatility to the portfolio volatility.
    Objective Function:
    Maximize∑i=1NwiσiwTΣw
    MaximizewTΣw

    ​∑i=1N​wi​σi​​

7. Black-Litterman Model

    Objective: Combine market equilibrium returns with investor views to determine the optimal portfolio weights.
    Objective Function:
    This model uses a blend of the equilibrium market weights and the investor's views:
    OptimizewT(Π+τΣPT(PΣPT+Ω)−1(Q−PΠ))
    OptimizewT(Π+τΣPT(PΣPT+Ω)−1(Q−PΠ))
    where ΠΠ is the equilibrium excess returns, PP is the pick matrix, QQ is the vector of views, ΩΩ is the uncertainty in the views, and ττ is a scalar indicating the weight of the views.

8. Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) Minimization

    Objective: Minimize the Conditional Value-at-Risk, a measure of the risk of extreme losses.
    Objective Function:
    Minimizeα+11−β∑i=1Nmax⁡{0,−(wTri+α)}
    Minimizeα+1−β1​i=1∑N​max{0,−(wTri​+α)}
    where αα is a threshold parameter, ββ is the confidence level, and riri​ are the individual asset returns.

9. Mean-Conditional Value-at-Risk (Mean-CVaR) Optimization

    Objective: Maximize the expected return subject to a CVaR constraint.
    Objective Function:
    MaximizewTμsubject toCVaR≤threshold
    MaximizewTμsubject toCVaR≤threshold

10. Factor Model Optimization

    Objective: Optimize portfolio based on factor exposures rather than individual assets.
    Objective Function:
    MinimizewTBFBTw
    MinimizewTBFBTw
    where BB is the factor loading matrix and FF is the factor covariance matrix.

These models can be chosen based on the investor's objectives, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Each model has its unique approach to balancing return and risk, and can be implemented using optimization techniques in programming environments like Python.
