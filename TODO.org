  + [-] *model.
    py* [7/11]
    + [X] fix structure linear_regression_model_train -> model_train -> run
    + [X] check print statements and loggin statements
    + [X] print portfolio weight matrix based on chosen timeperiod
    + [ ] histogram plot of residuals
    + [X] check rolling window dates
    + [X] check variable naming and comments
    + [X] make func for plotting the portfolio and stocks return with highlight
          also fix resampling for timeframes other than daily
    + [ ] add resampling into daily data for utils.graphPortfoliostocksperformance
    + [ ] add max and min variance of single stock over whole testing period
          so that it can be compared to the total portfolio variance
    + [ ] add other portfolio benchmarks like VaR SVaR, RMSE
    + [X] add graph of weights over time
  + [-] *eda.py* [2/5]
    + [ ] check stock cumulative returns graph
    + [ ] check plotWeeklystd
    + [ ] maybe add some comments and logs
    + [X] check naming conventions for funcs
    + [X] added logger
  + [ ] *utils.py* [0/1]
    + [ ] for the love of Terry please rename those fucking functions
  + [X] *clean_data.py* [1/1]
    + [X] checked everything, good to go
  + [-] *optimize.py* [1/3]
    + [X] check naming of funcs
    + [ ] add comments
    + [ ] calculate other values for portfolio performance:
      + Sortino Ratio
      + Maximum Drawdown
      + Skewness/Kurtosis of portfolio returns distribution
